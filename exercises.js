// Complete both of the following tasks:

// Review the list of global built-in objects on MDN - Global Objects. Disregarding
// global properties and functions, list three global objects you recall learning
// about in class and write a one sentence description of that object's purpose.

// 'Math: This object allows you to perform mathematical operations,
// like rounding numbers, generating random numbers, maximum, minimum, etc.'

// 'Date: This object lets us work with dates. You can manipulate data like
//  years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

// 'JSON: This object lets you convert any JavaScript object into JSON notation,
// so we can exchange data between a browser and a server
// We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.'

// Review the list of global built-in objects on MDN - Global Objects.
// Disregarding global properties and functions, list three global objects you
// have not learned about in class. Review the documentation for that object
// and write a one sentence description of its purpose.

// Set: The Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references.
// WeakMap: This object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced.  The keys must be objects and the values can be arbitrary values.
// Promise: This object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never.

// Write a program that does the following:
// Generate a random decimal number between 0 and 100 (EG: 93.60745257237626) and store it in a variable.

// Round the number to the nearest integer (EG: 94)

// Round the number up to the next largest integer (EG: 94)

// Round the number down to the next smallest integer (EG: 93)

// Print all four numbers out with labels.

// Write JavaScript code that generates a random integer in the range -10 to 10.
